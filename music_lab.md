## Music Collection

You have been asked to create an app that will allow a music collector to manage their collection of CDs/records.

## MVP

In their console they would like to be able to:

* Create and Save Artists DONE
* Create and Save Albums DONE
* List All Artists/Albums DONE
* List all the albums they have by an artist DONE
* Show the artist any album belongs to DONE

Every artist should have a name, and each album should have a name/title, genre and artist ID.

## Extensions

Additionally it would be nice to be able to:

* Edit Artists/Albums DONE
* Delete Artists/Albums DONE
* Find Artists/Albums by their ID

Remember to regularly git commit!
